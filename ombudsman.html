THREE months after Ombudsman Samuel Martires retired, we continue to find evidence of how the office he led for seven dismal years mutated from being a guardian of good governance to a protector of the powerful. These developments highlight what Ombudsman Jesus Crispin Remulla must do to repair the substantial damage left by his predecessor and restore public confidence in his office.
<br><br>
Last week, Remulla said he had stumbled upon an order by Martires that quietly reversed Sen. Joel Villanueva’s dismissal, which was ordered by then-Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales in 2016.
<br><br>
That year, she found Villanueva guilty of grave misconduct, serious dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the interest of the service for allegedly misusing P10 million of his Priority Development Assistance Fund when he was still a member of the House of Representatives.
<br><br>
Investigators from the Office of the Ombudsman said the funds were supposedly allocated for agriculture-based livelihood projects, but were channeled to a bogus nongovernmental organization. Investigators concluded that it was a ghost project when they found that the localities where the project was to be carried out were unsuitable for farming, and that the list of beneficiaries did not contain registered voters or residents of the province. Accomplishment and liquidation reports were fabricated.
<br><br>

Although the senator said the signature on the documents was forged, the ombudsman found him guilty and ordered his dismissal from public service, with the accessory penalty of perpetual disqualification from holding public office.
<br><br>
But the Senate, then headed by Aquilino Pimentel III, refused to carry out the order, claiming it alone had the power to discipline its members.

<br><br>

Then, in 2019, Martires secretly reversed the decision, without publication or public notice. It was made public only in 2025, when Remulla said he had planned to ask Senate President Vicente Sotto III to carry out the 2016 order.

<br><br>

“To my surprise, when I got to the office, I was confronted with a decision signed by former Ombudsman Martires dated July 2019,” Remulla said. “It’s a surprise, secret decision that came out.”
<br><br>
Martires denied that the order was secret, saying it just wasn’t publicized. He also said the senator had filed a motion for reconsideration “in a timely manner,” but added that he could no longer remember when.
<br><br>
In an online interview, Martires said it was not the job of the ombudsman to publicize its decisions, saying the office would no longer get any work done “if it held press conferences daily.” He also said he did not publicize cases to protect the dignity of the accused, who had yet to be found guilty by a court.
<br><br>

The response was absurd.
<br><br>
Contrary to Martires’ assertion, Section 15 of Republic Act 6770, which created the Office of the Ombudsman, lists among the ombudsman’s powers, functions and duties to “publicize matters covered by its investigation... when circumstances so warrant and with due prudence...”
<br><br>
While it is true that courts do not publicize every decision, the Villanueva dismissal was a high-profile case of national import. There was no legitimate reason for Martires to keep the reversal quiet. And in the case of Villanueva, would it not have upheld the senator’s dignity and reputation to announce to the world that he was innocent, after all?
<br><br>
Finally, Martires’ suggestion that he would have needed to call a press conference every day to keep the public informed is simply ludicrous. Nobody suggests that the ombudsman needs to brief the press every day, but certainly the public ought to be informed about important decisions — such as the Villanueva reversal.
<br><br>
The Ombudsman Act of 1989 says the ombudsman and his deputies are protectors of the people. In his stint as ombudsman, Martires seems to have misinterpreted that mandate by protecting only politically powerful people.
<br><br>
That was evident in 2020, when he severely restricted public access to the Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth that all government officials and employees are required to file. Thankfully, Remulla has reversed this misguided policy that kept government watchdogs, journalists and private citizens from using a powerful anti-corruption tool to determine if government officials were living beyond their legal means.
<br><br>
Thrown off balance by the Martires reversal, Remulla said his office would review the case.
<br><br>
“We were upended by the fact that Ombudsman Martires already released a decision in 2019 that nobody knew about except him and maybe Joel Villanueva,” Remulla said. “Only the two of them know. [But] we are not yet done. We will have to study.”
<br><br>

Given his predecessor’s dismal record, we suggest Ombudsman Remulla may need to look for more skeletons in the closet.
