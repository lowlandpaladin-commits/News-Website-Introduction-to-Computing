ACCORDING to a 2024 Philippine Statistics Authority survey, around 18.9 million Filipinos are functionally illiterate. This means that they can read, write and compute but lack the ability to fully comprehend and use information in daily life. This can be tied to the delivery of the teaching and learning experience. More bad news seems to be in the offing.
<br><br>
The Second Congressional Committee on Education (Edcom 2) has urged the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) to undertake immediate quality regulation on graduate programs, particularly within teacher education.
<br><br>
This was after the commission’s latest study found that hiring and promotions policies in government have contributed to the proliferation of poor-quality graduate education programs, especially in teacher education. The study was conducted by Anne Lan K. Candelaria, Eric Arthur N. Dio, and Jonelyn G. Delosa under a research fellowship with the Ateneo de Manila University.
<br><br>
The study’s findings highlight a systemic issue where policy incentives designed to uplift educators are inadvertently degrading instructional quality. Analyzing data from Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) submitted to CHED covering school year 2012-2013 up to SY 2023-2024, the investigator confirms that more than half of the country’s total enrollment in graduate programs is concentrated in the field of education.
<br><br>
This demand is sustained primarily by vertical qualification requirements and the point-based promotion system at the Department of Education.
<br><br>
The gravity of the situation is further underscored by severely low completion rates: 8 out of 10 graduate students are unable to complete their degree programs within the prescribed period of two years for master’s degrees and four years for doctoral programs.

<br><br>
The same study also noted how most specialized graduate programs are mainly offered by private universities and concentrated in Metro Manila. This limits accessibility to diverse options and specializations outside the National Capital Region, and out of reach for poor students.
<br><br>
Moreover, this has resulted in the proliferation of “diploma mills” in teacher education and public administration-related graduate programs. Existing policies fail to discriminate based on the quality of where the graduate credits or degrees were obtained. The study also notes that specialized degrees, such as those related to STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), are being marginalized, creating an imbalance in the production of specialized graduates needed by the public schools.

<br><br>
“Data from CHED shows that in the last 10 school years, more than half of the country’s total enrollment in graduate programs is in the field of education,” the authors noted in a separate article. “Yet, our students in the elementary and secondary education sectors have been lagging based on Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study and Program for the International Student Assessment results in the last 20 years.” They added: “In some of these years, the Philippines ranked at the bottom.” They further highlighted the unintended consequence of this trend, stating that the situation “has also created an imbalance in terms of how we are able to produce graduates with specialized knowledge in areas such as mathematics and the sciences, which our public schools badly need.” “Our study’s findings on program quality and the diploma-for-promotion cycle clearly resonate with the public and the practitioners. The feedback underscores a deep-seated frustration with the current system,” Edcom 2 Executive Director Dr. Karol Mark Yee said.
<br><br>
To solve these deep-seated systemic and structural inequalities, Edcom 2 strongly advocates for intensified governance and quality assurance from CHED. Crucially, the authors recommend that CHED adopt a tiered regulatory approach to HEIs offering graduate programs. They must shift away from a uniform policy to account for differences in institutional capacity programs, program quality and regional context.
<br><br>

This regulatory shift should be complemented by decisive action from the DepEd. The recommendation is that the DepEd should vet the quality of the graduate programs and the HEIs for career progression purposes. They must move beyond simply accepting degrees from any CHED-recognized institution.
<br><br>
The authors also urge interagency cooperation to initiate reform. “For a start, we recommend that CHED and the DepEd jointly review the impact of the policy of vertical alignment on graduate degrees based on current realities to address systemic and structural inequalities.” To ensure transparency and address the issue of unscrupulous institutions, CHED is further advised to regularly publish a “white list” of quality degree programs. Edcom 2 maintains that addressing the fundamental structural graduate education is key to advancing human capital development. This will also drive long-term inclusive growth that leaves no one behind, especially the poor.
