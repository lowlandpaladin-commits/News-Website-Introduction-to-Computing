Content creator Jeraldine Blackman has officially introduced fellow social media personality Justin Leo through a heartfelt post on her social media.
<br><br>
In her recent upload, Jeraldine shared a video compilation of her and Justin’s sweet moments together.

<br><br>
“Thank you for lifting me up on my hardest days. Thank you for making me smile and laugh again. Thank you for caring and loving me/us. HELLO EVERYONE! Meet Justin - he is nice, kind and the most thoughtful person in the world,” Jeraldine said.
<br><br>

In the comments section, Jeraldine also expressed her emotions while making the video and defended Justin against online criticism. 

<br><br>
“I’m crying so much making this video! Justin doesn’t deserve the hate and criticism he’s getting online. He is the kindest person ever! Please be nice to him ♥️,” she expressed.
<br><br>
The announcement comes after Jeraldine previously addressed rumors surrounding her relationship with Justin and her separation from her estranged husband, Josh Blackman.
<br><br>
Back in September, Jeraldine shut down allegations of infidelity following her split with Josh.
<br><br>
"I want to make this very clear: no one cheated in our marriage. Please stop assuming I did. There are also posts saying Josh cheated because of that Tinder post from last year—that account was fake, and it was someone pretending to be him," Jeraldine said.



<br><br>

Jeraldine emphasized that she and Josh continue to co-parent their two children peacefully.

<br><br>
"We will not be sharing any more details about our marriage. What matters now is that we are happy co-parenting, and we hope you can respect that," she added.
<br><br>
Following that statement, fans began noticing more posts featuring Jeraldine and Justin together, sparking speculation that the two had become a couple.
<br><br>
Just two weeks ago, Justin also posted a photo with Jeraldine, writing: “When your world feels heavy, I’ll lift you higher. When your heart aches, I’ll be its calm. When you’re vulnerable, I’ll stand as your shield. Why? Because that’s the bare minimum of a man’s job. You’ll never fall alone again.”
<br><br>

Jeraldine and Josh, known as The Blackman Family, gained popularity for their wholesome family content, sharing joyful moments from their life in Australia with their children, Jette and Nimo.
<br><br>
A proud Filipina, Jeraldine often highlights her heritage through her content, introducing Filipino culture to both her family and their growing global audience. Last year, the family traveled between the Philippines and Australia to visit relatives and personally meet their Filipino fans.
<br><br>
However, Jeraldine first revealed her separation from Josh in February, saying she had been waiting for the right time to share the news publicly.
<br><br>
"I have been trying to find the right time when I'm going to get the courage for me to post this one online. Josh and I have separated," she revealed in a post.

<br><br>

Despite their split, Jeraldine reaffirmed that they remain on good terms: "We’re good friends. I just know that he is a good person and he is the best father that Jette and Nimo could ever have," she said.
