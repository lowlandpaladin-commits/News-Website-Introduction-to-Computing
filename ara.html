Six months after the passing of veteran actor Ricky Davao, his daughter Ara Davao looked back on her most cherished memories with him through a moving Instagram video coupled with a touching poem.  
<br><br>
“Missing you every single day. It’s hard to believe it’s already been half a year,” the caption read.  
<br><br>

In the post, Ara shared a video compilation showing Ricky in his most candid moments as a dedicated father, grandfather, and a man whose laughter once filled their home. The video tribute opened with an intimate clip that captured their unfiltered bond, where they noted how much they will miss each other.  
<br><br>


As random videos of Ricky played, Ara’s voice could be heard reciting a poem, imagining what she would do if they could meet again to relive the moments they once shared:  

<br><br>

“If I could see you one more time, I know just what I'd do, 
<br><br>
‘cause all I've thought of since you left is one more day with you.  
<br><br>
There's notes in every margin about everything you've missed, 
<br><br>
and with every passing day more gets added to the list. 
<br><br>
I'd probably invite you to do things simple and mundane, 

<br><br>
like walk to get a coffee or listen to the rain. 
<br><br>
I talk about tomorrow like I know it's gonna come 
<br><br>
and for a few brief moments everything would not feel numb. 
<br><br>
I'd let you speak forever and hear every word you say
<br><br>
I won't take it for granted since I know you go away.”

<br><br>
In the next clips, Ricky is seen in his element where he danced, took photos, and moved with energy, the very activities he once enjoyed.  
<br><br>
“I'd ask all of the questions that I wish I'd asked before
<br><br>
I'd tell you that without you I am not whole anymore. 
<br><br>
I'd make sure that before you leave again you know the truth
<br><br>
About the very depths of the amount that I love you,” Ara continued.  
<br><br>
Ending the video, Ara gathered moments from her childhood to her adulthood, capturing the life she shared with her late father through the years.
<br><br>
“Before we said goodbye I would hold you tight as ever
<br><br>
The way you hold somebody right before they leave forever. 
<br><br>
I'd say I'll think of you every part of every day
<br><br>
You'd tell me that it won't be life if I live it that way. 

<br><br>
That you will be a part of everything I ever am
<br><br>
That I need to move on instead of trying to understand. 
<br><br>
And as our time ran out again I'd try to act real tough
<br><br>
 But no amount of time with you could ever be enough.
<br><br>
But I won't see you just once more, but again and again and again
<br><br>

Because the day that I do not will mean I've found my end. 
<br><br>
And even when that day does come, I'll see you that day too
<br><br>
Because the first person I'm looking for, once I get there, is you,” her poem ended.  
<br><br>
Ever since Ricky's passing, Ara has been constantly uploading videos and photos on her Instagram in honor of him. In one of her uploads, she celebrated her father's birthday, writing: “Happy birthday in heaven, Pa. Someday, we will dance again 🕊️”
<br><br>
It was on May 2 that Ricky's family announced his passing. In Ara's post, she said that the actor died peacefully surrounded by his loved ones. Although the family did not disclose a specific cause of death, Ara shared that her father “bravely faced complications related to cancer.”
<br><br>
In an interview with ABS-CBN, actress and Ricky's estranged wife Jackie Lou Blanco, said that the actor was diagnosed with stage 4 Lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system.
