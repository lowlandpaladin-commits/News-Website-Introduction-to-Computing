DESPITE the best efforts of the government and industry stakeholders, the tourism sector in the Philippines is identified as a laggard among Asian countries, one of several that have yet to fully recover to the levels of activity seen in 2019, prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. This is according to an analysis by Oxford Economics published last week, and it goes on to say that significant improvement is “not expected” in 2026. This may come as a surprise to our Department of Tourism (DOT), which has steadfastly touted the resurgence in tourism since the end of the pandemic. A modification of economic expectations and perhaps some adjustment to policies should be considered.
<br><br>
Oxford Economics describes the recovery of the tourism sector across Asia as “remaining uneven,” despite the passage of almost three years since the end of the pandemic. There is growth in most markets, the Philippines included, but of 11 major tourism markets assessed by Oxford Economics’ analysts, only four — Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and Malaysia — exceeded the 2019 levels of visitor arrivals this year, with Indonesia just falling short. The Philippines, on the other hand, is the second-worst performer on that list, just ahead of Taiwan, with visitor arrival levels only about 70 percent of what they were in the same nine-month period in 2019.
<br><br>
The one bright spot for the Philippines is that visitors are spending about 20 percent more per capita than they did in 2019. That still means that overall tourism revenues are lower than prior to the pandemic due to the lower visitor numbers, but the situation could be worse. South Korea, for example, despite having more visitors, has seen spending per tourist drop by about 25 percent.
<br><br>
Lower consumer spending is one major reason for the anemic recovery of the tourism sector. Slowing global growth means income and consumption growth are slowing as well, and travelers are being a bit more cautious in what they are spending. This alone means that Asian countries should not be looking to tourism to provide much of a buffer against economic headwinds such as the adverse effects of tariffs and slower global trade, according the Oxford Economics.
<br><br>
For the four Asian countries with the poorest-performing tourism sectors, there is another significant problem, which is the continuing absence of Chinese tourists in any appreciable numbers. The reasons why differ; Taiwan and India are affected by geopolitical tensions with China, safety concerns are keeping Chinese visitors away from Thailand, and Oxford Economics tags the Philippines’ visa policy as “the likely culprit” in the lack of Chinese travelers here. The ongoing crackdown on illegal gambling operations and the resulting arrest of a significant number of Chinese is also noted as a discouraging factor.
<br><br>
However, there are shifts in Chinese travel preferences and consumer habits that are beyond the control of any country’s tourism strategy and policy. Chinese consumer spending has been cooling for some time in general, and is likely to continue. Also, because China had one of the longest and most restrictive pandemic policies, domestic tourism received a boost in the form of government stimulus. That has been an economic success story for China, as record numbers of Chinese tourists are opting for domestic destinations.

<br><br>
None of this should be construed as a criticism of the DOT’s strategy and efforts, although some review of its approach and policies should be undertaken. One of the factors noted by Oxford Economics, the suspension of electronic visas for Chinese visitors, will likely be corrected this month, as that suspension is due to be lifted. That, however, is just one part of the bigger challenge, and it is apparent that the government’s and the tourism sector’s options for addressing other parts of the puzzle are severely limited. After all, even though China is an important source of tourism customers, it is not the only one, and arrivals are down from everywhere. It is not a case that tourists are opting to visit a different country, they are simply not traveling in the numbers policymakers and tourism stakeholders were hoping to see.
<br><br>
Going forward, it would seem prudent for our economic planners to adjust their assumptions about the expected contribution of tourism to the broader economy. The DOT and the industry should certainly continue to put forth all efforts to attract more visitors, but expectations should be managed. Taking a page from China’s book and promoting more domestic tourism can also help to fill some of the gap left by fewer international visitors.
